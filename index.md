### **Welcome to My Digital Portfolio**

![featured-image](/assets/featured-image-sm-2.jpg)

**Reliance Enwerem** is a researcher, data analyst, and educator exploring the intersections of **technology, literacy, and science communication**. A Doctoral Student at The University of Central Florida, this site showcases her ongoing projects, teaching materials, and scholarly work in scietific and technical communication, digital humanities, and digital rhetoric.

Her work focuses on how digital technologies and communication systems shape public understanding, access, and agencyâ€”from risk communication in global health to AI literacy and digital writing practices. She is especially interested in questions like:

* How do people navigate risk, trust, and misinformation in digitally mediated environments?

* What ethical and rhetorical challenges emerge when algorithms, archives, and public health communication intersect?

* How can technical and digital communication advance equity, transparency, and participation across communities and platforms?

### **Current Work**

Reliance is currently developing a project, "Advancing Health Access: An Analysis of Interface Rhetorics in Nigerian-led Telemedicine Platforms," to investigate how digital and rhetorical practices influence the way people understand and respond to risk communication, particularly in health and crisis contexts. She is interested in the intersection of digital humanities and technical communication, using archival research and digital methods to trace how narratives of disease, contagion, and responsibility circulate over time and across media. This research bridges **digital humanities**, **rhetoric and composition**, and **science communication**.
