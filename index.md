### **Welcome to My Digital Portfolio**

![featured-image](/assets/featured-image-2.png)

Hello! Iâ€™m **Reliance Enwerem**, a writer, researcher, and educator exploring the intersections of **technology, literacy, and science communication**. This site showcases my ongoing projects, teaching materials, and scholarly work in scietific and technical communication, digital humanities, and digital rhetoric.

My work focuses on how digital technologies and communication systems shape public understanding, access, and agencyâ€”from risk communication in global health to AI literacy and digital writing practices. Iâ€™m especially interested in questions like:

* How do people navigate risk, trust, and misinformation in digitally mediated environments?

* What ethical and rhetorical challenges emerge when algorithms, archives, and public health communication intersect?

* How can technical and digital communication advance equity, transparency, and participation across communities and platforms?

### **About This Site**

This portfolio serves as both a **professional showcase** and an **experimental space** for exploring the affordances of web-based composition and examining how digital environments shape communication, design, and meaning-making. Youâ€™ll find:

* **[Projects](projects/)** â€“ Research and creative work highlighting digital rhetoric, interface design, and online authorship.
* **[Teaching](teaching/)** â€“ Sample syllabi, assignments, and reflections on pedagogy in digital contexts.
* **[Research](research/)** â€“ Conferences, Publications & Research Activity.

All content is built using **Markdown**, **GitHub Pages**, and **Jekyll**, demonstrating how web literacies intersect with scholarly communication.

### **Current Work**

Iâ€™m currently developing a project that investigates how digital and rhetorical practices influence the way people understand and respond to risk communication, particularly in health and crisis contexts. I'm interested in the intersection of digital humanities and technical communication, using archival research and digital methods to trace how narratives of disease, contagion, and responsibility circulate over time and across media. This research bridges **digital humanities**, **rhetoric and composition**, and **science communication**.
